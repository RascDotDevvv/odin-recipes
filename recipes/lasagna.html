    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p><strong>Start by preparing the meat sauce. In a large skillet, sauté finely chopped onions and garlic in olive oil until golden brown. Add ground beef and cook until browned.</strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.</p>

    <p>Now, it's time to assemble. In a baking dish, layer the meat sauce, lasagna noodles, and cheese mixture. Repeat until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a generous layer of cheese on top. Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are golden brown. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing into the perfect, gooey, and flavorful lasagna layers. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
